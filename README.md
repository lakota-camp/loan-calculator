This project is based on the "Learn React by Building a Mortgage Calculator" series by [Joy Shaheb](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyShaheb). This tutorial was an excellent learning resource that helped me grasp the fundamentals of React, including state management and React hooks. In addition, this project introduced to me Material UI for creating modern and responsive user interfaces. The project not only reinforced my understanding of core React concepts but also allowed me to apply these in a practical context, showcasing my ability to build functional user interfaces with dynamic data handling.
